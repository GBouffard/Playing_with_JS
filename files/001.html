<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
-->

<html>
<head>
  <title>Boubou</title>

<!-- <style> in the head: If the "scoped" attribute is not used, each <style> tag must be located in the head section.
To link to an external style sheet, we can use the <link> tag.  -->

  <style>
    button {
      color: red;
      background: yellow
    }
  </style>

<!--This is a comment. Comments are not displayed in the browser-->

<!-- Scripts can be in head and body -->
<!-- <script></script> -->
<!-- <noscript> element is for users that have disabled scripts in their browser -->
  
</head>

<body>

<!--    <script type="text/javascript" src="001.js"></script> 
cannot be here else it gives:
Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null 
the order is important: the button needs to be there first. -->

  <button class="guillaume_button"> Click me </button>

<!-- script at the bottom - Safe place -->

  <script type="text/javascript" src="001.js"></script>

<!-- instead of a file reference, script could also be written in here.
 If the "src" attribute is present, the <script> element must be empty, else it can be like

<script>
  var myButton = document.querySelector('.guillaume_button');

  var doThis = function() {
    console.log("I clicked you!");
  };

  myButton.addEventListener('click', doThis);
</script>
